-- 1.5.3 (3 April 2008)
  * New helper model_auto_completer_result.
  * Yet another iteration through the docs.

-- 1.5.2 (2 April 2008)
  * Fixed bug that resulted in a corrupt text field if more than
    once selection was done clicking with the mouse.
  * More tests.

-- 1.5.1 (1 April 2008)
  * A bug fix in 1.5.0 introduced a regression, rollback.

-- 1.5.0 (31 March 2008)
  * Wrote semi-automated test suite
  * New option :append_random_suffix to be able to turn random suffixes off
  * New option :submit_on_return, alias of :send_on_return

    class name of the association

-- 1.4.1 (5 May 2007)
  * Reworded some bits of the documentation.

-- 1.4 (1 May 2007)
  * It turned out that Konqueror does no behave like Safari, so
    right now :send_on_return disables form submission only for
    Safari.

-- 1.3 (30 Apr 2007)
  * We only disable the return key in Safari and Konqueror (I assume
    Konqueror behaves like Safari, check pending) since Firefox and IE
    do not submit the form when you press return on the completion list.


-- 1.2 (29 Apr 2007)
  * Small change to the onkeypress handler.


-- 1.1 (25 Mar 2007)
  
  * [NEW] Added a callback that receives the text field element, the
  selected value, the hidden field element, and the extracted id.

  * [BUG] The foreign key was not properly retrieved sometimes
  (reported by James Stewart, thank you!)
