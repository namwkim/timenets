Description:
    Scaffolds a RubyAMF resource: model, migration, and controller. The
 	resource is ready to use as a RubyAMF service.

    Pass the name of the model, either CamelCased or under_scored, as the first
    argument, and an optional list of attribute pairs.

    Attribute pairs are column_name:sql_type arguments specifying the
    model's attributes. Timestamps are added by default, so you don't have to
    specify them by hand as 'created_at:datetime updated_at:datetime'.

    You don't have to think up every attribute up front, but it helps to
    sketch out a few so you can start working with the resource immediately.

    For example, `rubyamf_scaffold post title:string body:text published:boolean`
    gives you a model with those three attributes, a controller that handles
    the find/save/destroy.

Examples:
    `./script/generate rubyamf_scaffold post` # no attributes
    `./script/generate rubyamf_scaffold post title:string body:text published:boolean`
    `./script/generate rubyamf_scaffold purchase order_id:integer amount:decimal`
